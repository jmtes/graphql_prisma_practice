# What CASCADE means is that, in a one-to-many relationship, if the one gets deleted then the many get deleted as well.
# What SET_NULL means is that, in a one-to-many relationship, if one of the many get deleted, it is simply set to NULL in the one's mapping to the many.
# Since we're saying nothing can be null in the arrays below, that would result in simply removing the entry.

# Example: In line 21, we're saying that if a post gets deleted, it should simply be set to NULL in the User's record.
# In line 22, we're saying that if a post gets deleted, all the comments associated with it should be deleted as well.
